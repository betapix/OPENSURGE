## About

## Advanced

### Command-line options

Run `opensurge --help`

### Paths

Check the *Engine information* at the options screen to see where the files are.

Content is distributed in the following locations:

- `bin`: executable file
- `share`: game assets (images, audio, levels, scripts, etc.)
- `user`: user-modifiable data (preferences, logs, screenshots, additional assets such as user-made levels)

The default paths of these locations vary according to the platform:

- Windows (.zip package):
    * `bin`: `./opensurge.exe`
    * `share`: `.`
    * `user`: `.` or `%OPENSURGE_USER_PATH%`

- Linux:
    * `bin`: `/usr/games/opensurge`
    * `share`: `/usr/share/games/opensurge/`
    * `user`: `~/.local/share/opensurge/` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opensurge/` or `$OPENSURGE_USER_PATH`

- Linux (Flatpak):
    * `bin`: `flatpak run org.opensurge2d.OpenSurge`
    * `share`: `/var/lib/flatpak/app/org.opensurge2d.OpenSurge/current/active/files/share/opensurge/`
    * `user`: `~/.var/app/org.opensurge2d.OpenSurge/data/opensurge/` or `$OPENSURGE_USER_PATH`

    If you use `$OPENSURGE_USER_PATH`, make sure it points to a subdirectory of `~/Downloads` (`$XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR`).

- Linux (Snap):
    * `bin`: `snap run opensurge`
    * `share`: `/snap/opensurge/current/share/games/opensurge/`
    * `user`: `~/snap/opensurge/current/.local/share/opensurge/` or `$OPENSURGE_USER_PATH`

    If you use `$OPENSURGE_USER_PATH`, make sure it points to a subdirectory of your home folder.

- macOS:
    * `bin`: `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share`: `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`: `~/Library/Application Support/opensurge/` or `$OPENSURGE_USER_PATH`

If you intend to hack the game, it's easier to have all files in the same place (read-write), because some of the above folders are read-only. Download the sources (use the same engine version), extract them to your filesystem and use the `--game-folder` command-line option.

Tip: you can also use the command-line option `--verbose`. The directories will appear at the beginning of the output.

### Compiling the engine

Dependencies:

* [Allegro](http://liballeg.org) version 5.2.7 or later (5.2.10 on Android)
* [SurgeScript](http://github.com/alemart/surgescript) version 0.6.1
* [PhysicsFS](https://github.com/icculus/physfs) version 3.2.0 (recommended) or 3.0.2

Compile as usual:

```
cd /path/to/opensurge/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install
```

Use `cmake-gui` or `ccmake` for tweaking, like installing the engine to or finding the dependencies on non-standard paths.
